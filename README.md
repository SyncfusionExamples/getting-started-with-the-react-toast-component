# Getting Started with the React Toast Component

The [React Toast](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-toast?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-toast-github-samples) is a small, nonblocking notification pop-up. It is a readable message displayed at the bottom of the screen or at a specific target and disappears automatically after a few seconds (time out) with different animation effects. A quick start project that shows how to create and configure the Syncfusion React toast component in a React project. This sample contains simple code to explain the different toast positions, time out, and how to render the toast content using an HTML template.

## Project prerequisites
Make sure that you have the compatible versions of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download ) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or later version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application
To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-the-react-toast-component` repository and then open it in Visual Studio Code. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

### Positioning notifications
The React toast notifications component is easily positioned wherever you want using built-in positions or custom axis values (X, Y).

### Animation
Users can configure different animations to show or hide the toast and the animation duration based on the content length of the notification message and reading time.

### Interactive toasts
Users can create a more interactive toast message by configuring inputs and buttons on the notification pop-up that help them react quickly (for example, reply to a chat message directly from the toast pop-up).
